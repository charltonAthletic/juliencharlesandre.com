        <h1><span>About</span><span style="color: #FFF"> Julien Charles</span> <span style="color: #EF4135"> André</h1>
        </span>
        <p>
            Julien Charles André was born in Nice, France in 1980, to a family with a long history
            of architectural design and <i>craftsmanship</i>.

            <img src="/gallery-images/2.jpg" alt="Julien Charles André with some his recent artwork" />
            <div>
                <h3><i>Histoire</i></h3>
                <p>
                    His great grandfather, A. Boutillier, was a
                    master of printing with an atelier producing travel trunk labels for the most exclusive
                    luxury hotels in Paris in the early 20th century.

        <section class="card" data-aos="fade-left">
            <img src="/gallery-images/18.jpg" alt="Julien Charles André with some his recent artwork" />
            <div>
                <h3><i>Inspiration</i></h3>
                <p>
                    Drawing inspiration from his great
                    grand-father, Julien developed a strong interest in art and design, in particular, with
                    colours, shapes and print-making. He began collecting <i>antique engravings</i> from five years ago,
                    and started
                    experimenting colour variations and mixing with other media, mostly paper and
                    goldleaf, to create collages on the side of his job as a luxury retail stores’ visual
                    merchandiser.

        <section class="card" data-aos="fade-right">
            <img src="/gallery-images/19.jpg"
                alt="Some of Julien Charles André's first 'Greek Divinity Theme' pieces of artwork" />
            <div>
                <h3><b>L'Italie</b></h3>
                <p>
                    In 2016, he went on an inspirational trip to Tuscany, Italy at Villa Lena
                    Art Foundation, where he created his first series with a Greek Divinity Theme. After
                    returning to London, he started exhibiting works in hotels and restaurants in between
                    London, Paris and Aix-en-Provence – where he grew up. More recently, he has
                    developed two new themes: <i>Architecture and Animal Kingdom</i>. He was also
                    commissioned by his collectors and interior designers for various site specific works
                    as well as bespoke framing for the art.

        <section class="card" data-aos="fade-left">
            <img src="/gallery-images/58.jpeg" alt="Julien Charles André photograph" />
            <div>
                <h3><b>Création</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Without any formal art training, he creates the compositions based on how he
                    experiences and interacts with objects and themes, and experiments around how to
                    represent <i>classical art</i> forms in a contemporary setting. His works somewhat sit
                    between neo-classical, pop-art and decorative items for interior design without clear
                    boundaries.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Le style</h3>
                <p>
                    His instantly recognisable style projects his belief that modern art
                    shouldn’t have to be complicated or resulting in distance itself from the audience. He
                    developed his own technique of creating 3D light-box effects through layering paper
                    with striking colour reflection in goadleaf ‘shadows’. He approaches antiquities and
                    ancient art with his modern and relaxed attitude. He strongly believes that it is
                    possible to achieve strong <i>artistic vision</i> with decorative purposes in mind at the
                    same time. Each piece is uniquely created by the artist in its own universe of
                    emotions, atmosphere and surreal settings, closely connected to experience and
                    connections he has about the subjects.
