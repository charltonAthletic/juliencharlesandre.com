        <br>
        <p>
            Julien Charles André was born in Nice, France in 1980, to a family with a long history
            of architectural design and <i>craftsmanship</i>. His great grandfather, A. Boutillier, was a
            master of printing with an atelier producing travel trunk labels for the most exclusive
            luxury hotels in Paris in the early 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drawing inspiration from his great
            grand-father, Julien developed a strong interest in art and design, in particular, with
            colours, shapes and print-making. He began collecting <i>antique engravings</i> from five years ago, and started
            experimenting colour variations and mixing with other media, mostly paper and
            goldleaf, to create collages on the side of his job as a luxury retail stores’ visual
            merchandiser.
        <p>
            In 2016, he went on an inspirational trip to Tuscany, Italy at Villa Lena
            Art Foundation, where he created his first series with a Greek Divinity Theme. After
            returning to London, he started exhibiting works in hotels and restaurants in between
            London, Paris and Aix-en-Provence – where he grew up. More recently, he has
            developed two new themes: <i>Architecture and Animal Kingdom</i>. He was also
            commissioned by his collectors and interior designers for various site specific works
            as well as bespoke framing for the art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without any formal art training, he creates the compositions based on how he
            experiences and interacts with objects and themes, and experiments around how to
            represent <i>classical art</i> forms in a contemporary setting. His works somewhat sit
            between neo-classical, pop-art and decorative items for interior design without clear
            boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            His instantly recognisable style projects his belief that modern art
            shouldn’t have to be complicated or resulting in distance itself from the audience. He
            developed his own technique of creating 3D light-box effects through layering paper
            with striking colour reflection in goadleaf ‘shadows’. He approaches antiquities and
            ancient art with his modern and relaxed attitude. He strongly believes that it is
            possible to achieve strong <i>artistic vision</i> with decorative purposes in mind at the
            same time. Each piece is uniquely created by the artist in its own universe of
            emotions, atmosphere and surreal settings, closely connected to experience and
            connections he has about the subjects.
